<h3>
<b>What is DLL(Data Link Layer)</b></h3>
The Data Link Layer is the second layer in the OSI model, above the Physical Layer, which ensures that
the error free data is transferred between the adjacent nodes in the network.	It breaks the datagrams passed down 
by above layers and convert them into frames ready for transfer. This is called Framing. It provides two main functionalities
<ul>
<li>Reliable data transfer service between two peer network layers
<li>Flow Control mechanism which regulates the flow of frames such that data congestion 
is not there at slow receivers due to fast senders.
</ul>
<b><h3>What is Framing?</h3></b>
Since the physical layer merely accepts and transmits a stream of bits without any 
regard to meaning or structure, it is upto the data link layer to create and recognize
frame boundaries. This can be accomplished by attaching special bit patterns to the beginning and
end of the frame. If these bit patterns can accidentally occur in data, special care must be taken
to make sure these patterns are not incorrectly interpreted as frame delimiters.
The four framing methods that are widely used are
<ul>
<li>Character count
<li>Starting and ending characters, with character stuffing
<li>Starting and ending flags, with bit stuffing
<li>Physical layer coding violations
</ul>
<h4>Character Count</h4>
This method uses a field in the header to specify the number of characters in the frame. 
When the data link layer at the destination sees the character count,it knows how 
many characters follow, and hence where the end of the frame is. The disadvantage is 
that if the count is garbled by a transmission error, the destination will lose 
synchronization and will be unable to locate the start of the next frame. So, this
method is rarely used.
<h4>Character stuffing</h4>
In the second method, each frame starts with the ASCII character sequence 
DLE STX and ends with the sequence DLE ETX.(where DLE is Data Link Escape, 
STX is Start of TeXt and ETX is End of TeXt.) This method overcom
