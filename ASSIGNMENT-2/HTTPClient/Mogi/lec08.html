<h3>
<b>Phase Jitter Compensation :</b></h3>
In a token ring the source starts discarding all it's previously transmitted
bits as soon as they circumnavigate the ring and reach the source. Hence,
it's not desirable that while a token is being sent some bits of the token
which have already been sent become available at the incoming end of the
source. This behavior though is desirable in case of data packets which
ought to be drained from the ring once they have gone around the ring.
To achieve the aforesaid behavior with respect to tokens, we would like
the ring to hold at least 24 bits at a time. How do we ensure this?
