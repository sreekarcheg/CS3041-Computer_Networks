<center><h2>CSMA with Collision Avoidance</h2></center><p>
We have observed that CSMA/CD would break down in wireless networks because of hidden node and
exposed nodes problems. We will have a quick recap of these two problems through examples.

<h3>Hidden Node Problem</h3>
In the case of wireless network it is possible that A is sending a message to B, but C is out of its range and hence while "listening" on the network it will find the network to be free and might try to send packets to B at the same time as A. So, there will be a collision at B. The problem can be looked upon as if A and C are hidden from each other. Hence it is called the "hidden node problem".

<h3>Exposed Node Problem</h3>
If C is transmitting a message
