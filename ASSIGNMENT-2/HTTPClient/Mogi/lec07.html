<center><h2>IEEE 802.5: Token Ring Network</h2></center><p>

<ul>
<li>Token Ring is formed by the nodes connected in ring format as shown in the diagram below. The principle used  in the token ring network is that a token is circulating in the ring and whichever node grabs that token will have right to transmit the data.  
<li>Whenever a station wants to transmit a frame it inverts a single bit of the 3-byte token which instantaneously changes it into a normal data packet. Because there is only one token, there can atmost be one transmission at a time.  
<li>Since the token rotates in the ring  it is guarenteed that every node gets the token with in some specified time. So there is an upper bound on the time of waiting to grab the
