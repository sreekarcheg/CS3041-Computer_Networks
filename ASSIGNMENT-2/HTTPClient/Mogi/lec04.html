<h3>Multiplexing</h3>
When two communicating nodes are connected through a media, it generally happens that bandwidth of media is several 
times greater than that of the communicating nodes. Transfer of a single signal at a time is both slow and expensive. 
The whole capacity of the link is not being utilized in this case. This link can be further exploited by sending 
several signals combined into one. This combining of signals into one is called multiplexing.

<ol>
<li><b>Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM): </b>This is possible in the case where transmission media has a bandwidth 
than the required bandwidth of signals to be transmitted. A number of signals can be transmitted at the same time. 
Each source is allotted a
