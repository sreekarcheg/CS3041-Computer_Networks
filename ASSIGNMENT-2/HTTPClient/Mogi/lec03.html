<h3>Digital data to analog signals</h3> A modem (modulator-demodulator) converts digital data to analog signal. 
There are 3 ways to modulate a digital signal on an analog carrier signal.
<ol>
<li><b>Amplitude shift keying (ASK):</b> is a form of modulation which represents digital data as variations in 
the amplitude of a carrier wave. Two different amplitudes of carrier frequency represent '0' , '1'.

<li><b>Frequency shift keying (FSK):</b> In Frequency Shift Keying, the change in frequency define different digits. 
Two different frequencies near carrier frequency represent '0' ,''1'.

<li><b>Phase shift keying (PSK):</b> The phase of the carrier is discretely varied in relation either to a reference 
phase or to the phase of the immediately preceding signal element, in accordance with data being transmitted. Phase 
of carrier signal is shifted to represent '0' , '1'.

<h3> Digital data to digital signals</h3>
A digital signal is sequence of discrete , discontinuous voltage pulses. Each pulses a signal element. Encoding scheme is an important factor in how successfully the receiver interprets the incoming signal.
<P><h3>Encoding Techniques</h3>Following are several ways to map data bits to signal elements.
<ul>
<li><B>Non return to zero(NRZ)</B> NRZ codes share the property that voltage level is constant during a bit interval. 
High level voltage = bit 1 and Low level voltage = bit 0. A problem arises when there is a long
sequence of 0s or 1s and the volatage level is maintained at the same value for a long time. This creates a problem on
the recieving end because now, the clock synchronization is lost due to lack of any transitions and hence, it is difficult
to determine the exact number of 0s or 1s in this sequence.
